# Stat-Project-1

## We have been approached by Blue Nile to perform the following tasks:

1. Use data visualizations to explore how price is related to the other variables (carat, clarity, color, cut), as well as how the other variables may relate to each other. Address the various claims on the diamond education page on Blue Nile.

2. Fit an appropriate simple linear regression for price against carat.
